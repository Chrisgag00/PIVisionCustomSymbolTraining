FTable symbol control.

Definition :
1- This symbol will be used to see events attributes in a column. 
2- Each event will show on a different column
3- An event can or can not have a specific value for an attribute (it will show nothing in that position)
4- The event need to have : %STARTTIME:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff% as naming pattern


This is what will be added later:
1- Line in the grid
2- Possibility of moving up and down the attribute
3- The ability of moving an event and not the attribute (if possible) . 
a. Add a table to define which attribute will show when you drag the event
4- Create our own pan
